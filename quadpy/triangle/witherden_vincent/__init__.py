Abstract:
In this paper we describe a methodology for the identification of symmetric quadrature
rules inside of quadrilaterals, triangles, tetrahedra, prisms, pyramids, and hexahedra.
The methodology is free from manual intervention and is capable of identifying a set of
rules with a given strength and a given number of points. We also present polyquad which
is an implementation of our methodology. Using polyquad v1.0 we proceed to derive a
complete set of symmetric rules on the aforementioned domains. All rules possess purely
positive weights and have all points inside the domain. Many of the rules appear to be
new, and an improvement over those tabulated in the literature.
