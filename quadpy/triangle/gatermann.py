Abstract:
The weights and nodes of a symmetric cubature formula are determined by solving a system
of nonlinear equations. The number of equations and their structure are investigated for
symmetric cubature formulas for the square and the triangle. A new cubature formula of
degree 7 with 12 nodes is given for the triangle.
