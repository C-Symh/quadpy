    Abstract:
    Sphere close packed (SCP) lattice arrangements of points are well-suited
    for formulating symmetric quadrature rules on simplexes, as they are
    symmetric under affine transformations of the simplex unto itself in 2D and
    3D. As a result, SCP lattice arrangements have been utilized to formulate
    symmetric quadrature rules with Np = 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, and 56 points on the
    3-simplex (Shunn and Ham, 2012). In what follows, the work on the 3-simplex
    is extended, and SCP lattices are employed to identify symmetric quadrature
    rules with Np = 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, and 66 points on the
    2-simplex and Np = 84 points on the 3-simplex. These rules are found to be
    capable of exactly integrating polynomials of up to degree 17 in 2D and up
    to degree 9 in 3D.
